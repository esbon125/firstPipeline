Primitive Assembly, clipping and rasterization.

Primitive Assembly: consists of grouping vertices into lines and trinagles. This is done also for
points, in which case it's trivial. 

Clipping: once primitives have been built up from their individual vertices, they are clipped against
the displayable region, that is usually the window or the screen, but sometimes refer to a smaller one
known as the viewport. 

Rasterization: fixed-function process that determines the pixels covered by the primitive and send
them to the next stage, that is the fragment shading.

Through all the front-end, homogeneous coordinates are used. Right before clipping, projective
division takes place, which converts from homogeneous to cartesian coordinates.

Culling: optional stage in which is decided whether a triangle faces towards or away the viewer.
If it's towards, it's called front-facing, otherwise is called back-facing. This determined by the
by the sign of the area of the triangle. If it's positive, it's front-facing, if negative back-facing.
